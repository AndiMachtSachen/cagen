# cagen

`cagen` is a prototypical helper for the work with contract automata. 

This program offers you the construction of proof obligations based on a system description and contract automata. 
There are different proof obligations. 

We recommend you to use [nuXmv](https://nuxmv.fkb.eu), [cbmc](https://www.cprover.org/cbmc/) and [seahorn](https://github.com/seahorn/seahorn).

## Input Language

Note that cagen tries to be small, simple and flexible.
We built upon the expression language of SMV (+ a syntactic sugar), which is translated into C. This means:

| Bool literals         |                                                                                                                                                             | `true`, `FALSE`                                                   |
| Arithmetic operations |                                                                                                                                                             | `+`,`-`,`/`,`*`                                                   |
| Logical operations    | Only a single bar, or ampersand.                                                                                                                            | `\|`,`&`,`!`                                                      |

We have implemented support to Booleans and Integer (32-bit signed) only. 

### Contract Automata 

In our model, we have two entities. The first one is the contract automata defined as 

```
contract <name> {
    input <var> : <type>
    output <var> : <type>

    history <var>(<int>)

    refines <name> <binding>    

    <state> -> <state> :: pre ==> post    
}
```

A contract has a name and a signature (input and output variables). Additionally, a state storing the historical values requested by the `history` including the name and depth. A contract can refine another contract for this you can also define a mapping between those. A mapping looks like this `[x <- y, ...]`, where `x` is the variable in the refined contract, and `y` is the variable in the current contract. (No expression currently supported).

The special thing about contract automata is the states, which are defined via their mentioning in a transition. A transition goes from one state to the other if the "pre" and "post" (given in double quotes) are fulfilled.

### System 

The second entity is the systems, which have to shape: either there are given as a program fragment, quoted in `{= ... =}`, or as a composed system. A system also has a list of variables (input, output, and state). With `contract <name> <binding>` you can define a contract for a system.
Here is the example from the paper using a program:

``` 
reactor Counter  {
    input  tick : bool
    output val : int
    state  down : bool

    contract UpDown[cnt <- val, tick <- tick]

    {=
        if(tick) {
        if(!down) {
            val += 1;
        } else {
            val -= 1;
        }

        if(val == 128 || val == -128) down = !down;
        }
    =}
}
```

A composed system instead is given by subsystems and their interconnections. Subsystems are state variables, which input and output variables can be connected.

```
reactor Top {
   state sub1 : Sub
   state sub2 : Sub

   input in : int
   output out : int

   in -> sub1.in
   sub1.out -> sub1.in
   sub2.out -> out
}

reactor Sub {
   input in : int
   output out : int
   {= out = 2*in; =}
}
```

## Tool usage

You can compile the tool with Gradle: 
```sh
$ gradle shadowJar
```
and then you can run the proof obligation generation with:
```sh
$ java -jar build/libs/cagen-all.jar verify --output out Counter.sys
```
which generates the proof obligations into the `out/` directory to discharged with cbmc, seahorn or nuXmv. 

## Runtime verification
You can compile the tool with Gradle by running
```sh
$ ./gradlew shadowJar
```
in the project directory.
To generate the program code run 
```sh
$ java -jar ../../build/libs/cagen-all.jar rca Burner.sys
```
in the `examples/gasburner` directory.
This generates the c++ source and header files for the monitor and the system implementation in the `rca_output` subdirectory.
You can compile them using any c++17 compliant compiler.
The supported flags for the monitor are:

| Flag               | Description                                                                           |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MONITOR_RATE       | specify optional re-check rate to wait if system update is not ready                  |
| STOP_ON_EMPTY      | stop processing a trace when no tokens remain                                         |
| UNBOUNDED_TRACE    | keep all previous values in a trace                                                   |
| DISPLAY_TRACES     | display clock valuation traces                                                        |
| DISPLAY_IOT        | display timed input-output values                                                     |
| RINGBUFFER         | use ringbuffer for bounded traces                                                     |
| FUZZY              | use fuzzy implementation                                                              |
| DEDUPLICATE_TOKENS | deduplicate equivalent tokens                                                         |
| ERROR_TRACE_ACCESS | treat out of bounds `old` access as contract violation instead of using default value |

The system implementation source file is named after the respective `reactor`.
The monitor implementation consists of the source file named after the `contract` and the `_monitor` file of the same name that should be compiled together.
The customization points for the fuzzy implementation are in `fuzzy_impl.hpp`.
The system and monitor expect a path to the file for sending/receiving the timed input-output traces as the first command line argument.

## Case Study

The case study for the paper is archived in `paper-experiments/`, where you can find `Counter` and `aeb` with their proof obligations, and a make file for discharging the proof. 

To run the case study, you should install `cbmc`, and `nuXmv`. Seahorn is used via `podman` (a docker variant for non-root use).  
Note that the time measuring of `podman` (`/usr/bin/time podman ...`) does not return the true value of cpu time.
